## 📝 Video Summary

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to analyze a YouTube video for NMIXX's "Blue Valentine" M/V. First, I need to understand the video's content based on the provided info. The title is in Korean, and the description includes Korean and English elements.

The video is a music video, so I should focus on the song's theme. The title "Blue Valentine" suggests a romantic or emotional tone. Since it's a K-pop group, the MV likely has a visual narrative. The duration is 195 seconds, which is about 3 minutes, so it's concise. The channel is JYP Entertainment, so the style might be typical of their artists.

The description mentions official social media links and copyrights, which is standard. The user wants a two-part summary. The key point should be concise, stating the video's purpose and main theme. The detailed summary needs to cover the theme, visuals, target audience, and purpose. Since the description is minimal, I should note that but not overemphasize. I need to ensure the summaries are in natural English without markdown. Also, avoid any repetition of labels. Let me check the example response to match the structure. Make sure not to include any extra information beyond the video's content. Alright, time to draft the responses.

## 💬 Audience Reaction Summary

**Comments Analyzed**: 20 / 20 (100.0%)

Okay, let's tackle this analysis. The user wants me to look at the YouTube comments for NMIXX's "Blue Valentine" M/V and summarize the sentiment. The key points are the two-part structure: KEY POINT and DETAILED SUMMARY, plus the sentiment breakdown.

First, I need to process all the comments. There are 20 comments, each with likes. The highest engagement is the first one, which is very emotional, talking about the group's journey and their impact. Then there's a lot of positive feedback in Korean, English, and Japanese. The comments mention the song's quality, the group's uniqueness, the music video's visuals, and the emotional impact.

Looking at the majority sentiment, it's clearly positive. People are praising the group's growth, the song's emotional depth, and the music video's production. Some comments highlight the blend of different emotions in the song, which is a common theme. There are mentions of the group's unique style and how they maintain their identity while appealing to a broader audience.

Minority views might include some concerns about the song's potential success, but even those are positive. For example, one comment worries about the group's marketability but still expresses hope. Others mention the song's nostalgic vibe and how it fits the season, which is a positive aspect.

Cultural differences might be in the language used, but since the comments are in Korean, English, and Japanese, the themes are consistent across languages. The sentiment breakdown should reflect that almost all comments are positive, with a small percentage neutral or negative. But since the user said to ignore outliers, maybe the negative ones are minimal. Wait, the context says to ignore spam, jokes, and extreme outliers, so maybe the negative comments are just a few. But looking at the comments, the only one that might be slightly negative is comment 17, which says "if not then I don't know what else song will be" but that's still positive. So maybe the sentiment is almost all positive. Let me check the likes. The highest is 806, then 691, etc. The lowest is 12 likes. So the sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. The breakdown would be positive 95%, neutral 5%, negative 0%? But the user wants exact percentages. Wait, the instructions say to sum to 100%, but the example might have different numbers. But since the comments are all positive, maybe it's 95% positive

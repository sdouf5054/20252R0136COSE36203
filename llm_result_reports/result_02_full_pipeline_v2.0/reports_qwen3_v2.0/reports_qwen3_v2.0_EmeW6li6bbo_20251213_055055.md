## 📝 Video Summary

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a summary of the NMIXX "Blue Valentine" M/V from the provided video info. First, I need to check the title and description. The title is in Korean, and the description has a mix of languages: Korean, English, and some Japanese terms like "日本語" but they're probably just labels. The main content is the music video.

The video's category is Music, duration 195 seconds, from JYP Entertainment. The description includes social media links and copyright info. The user mentioned that the title and description might be in Korean, English, or Japanese. But looking at the title, it's clearly Korean: "NMIXX(엔믹스) “Blue Valentine” M/V". The description has some Korean text like "NMIXX Official YouTube ▶" and then English hashtags. 

So the main task is to create a summary in English. The user wants the summary to capture key points, theme, and purpose. Since the video is a music video, the summary should mention the song title, the group, the genre or theme, and maybe the visual elements. The user also emphasized accuracy, so I shouldn't add info not present. The description is minimal, so I need to note that. 

Wait, the video is 195 seconds, which is about 3 minutes. That's a short music video. The title "Blue Valentine" suggests a romantic or emotional theme. Since it's a K-pop group, the MV might have a narrative or visual storytelling. The user wants the summary in English, so I need to translate the title and any key elements from the description. 

The description has hashtags like #NMIXX, #BlueValentine, etc. The copyright info is standard. The social media links are part of the channel's branding. The main points are the group NMIXX, the song "Blue Valentine", the M/V, and the channel. Since there's no detailed description beyond the title and links, the summary should focus on the song title, the group, and the purpose of the video (promoting the song). 

I need to make sure not to hallucinate any details. The user mentioned cultural context, so even if the description is minimal, I should note that. The summary should be 3-5 sentences. Let me structure that: first sentence introduces the video, mentions the group and song. Second sentence could talk about the theme or visuals if possible

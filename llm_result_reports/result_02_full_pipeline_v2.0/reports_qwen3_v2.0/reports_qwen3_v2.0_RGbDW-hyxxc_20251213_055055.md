## 📝 Video Summary

<think>
Okay, let's start by looking at the video title: "How well do I know ROBLOX | ALBERTGUESSR". The user mentioned that the title and description might be in Korean, English, Japanese, or a mix. The description includes a thank you to @KadenFumblebottom, mentions playing Roblox GeoGuessr by teleporting into Roblox games to guess them, and lists links to games in different modes. The category is Gaming, duration 1630 seconds (about 27 minutes), and the channel is Flamingo.

First, I need to confirm the language of the title and description. The title seems in English. The description has some English words but also mentions "Temprist's Pizza Picks" which might be a reference to a specific game or a user. The links are in English, so the main content is likely in English. 

The main activity is playing Roblox GeoGuessr, which is a game where players guess locations based on clues. The creator is teleporting into Roblox games to guess them, which suggests they're exploring various Roblox worlds and trying to identify them. The video is divided into different difficulty modes: Easy, Medium, Hard, Impossible. Some games might have been removed from Roblox due to updates, so the links could be outdated. The user also mentions a "Temprist's Pizza Picks" which might be a specific game or a series.

The purpose of the video is to test the creator's knowledge of Roblox games by having them guess the titles or locations of different worlds. The structure includes different difficulty levels, indicating a progression from easier to harder games. The creator acknowledges that some links are no longer available, which affects the content. The video is part of a gaming channel, so it's likely a gameplay series where the host challenges themselves to guess Roblox games, using the GeoGuessr mechanic.

I need to make sure the summary captures that the video is a gameplay series where the creator guesses Roblox games by teleporting into them, with different difficulty levels, and notes that some games are unavailable. Also, mention the collaboration with KadenFumblebottom. Keep it concise, 3-5 sentences in English.

## 💬 Audience Reaction Summary

<think>
Okay, let me start by looking at the comments provided. The video is about Albert guessing how well he knows Roblox, and the comments are in English, but there might be other languages too. The user mentioned Korean, Japanese, and mixed-language comments, so I need to check for those.

First, I'll go through each comment one by one. The majority are in English, but I need to be careful for any mixed-language ones. For example, comment 13 says "i had a dream last night that we went to a waterpark. just thought i'd say that" – that's all English. Wait, but the user mentioned that there might be Korean or Japanese comments. Let me check again. The example given was a mixed comment like "이 노래 진짜 beautiful하다" which is Korean and English. But in the provided comments, I don't see any obvious mixed-language comments. Wait, maybe I need to check again. Let me scan through each comment again.

Looking at comment 1: "I want a divorce, Albert." That's English. Comment 2: "Yes we love to see Kaden back" – English. Comment 3: "KADEN IS OUT OF PRISON, YAYYYYYYYY" – English. Comment 4: "ANOTHER 30 MIN VID?? WE ARE BEING BLESSED "THANK YOU ALBERT" WE ALL SAY IN UNISON" – English. Comment 5: "OMG I HAVENT SEEN KADEN IN FOREVER!!" – English. Comment 6: "love when kaden helps out small creators like flamingo <3" – English. Comment 7: "5:21 It's unfortunate to see that it basically got abandoned after the game was shut down." – English. Comment 8: "OMG I HAVENT SEEN KADEN IN FOREVER!!" – same as comment 5. Comment 9: "WE NEED DANI, JANDEL, KADEN, DENIS, TEMPRIST, MILES BACK LIKE THE OLDS DAYYSS" – English.
